## Chapter 6: The End of Fundamentals

To me, it seems you have been presented with enough information to really take off running
with all of this. Building things with all of this new found knowledge tends to be intimidating,
but breaking things down to their essential parts really helps with making progress. That is why,
there is actually a website to go along with this learning. This was made with the intent of guiding
your learning through practical applications, and giving you an experience of seeing some of your efforts
more visually. Another added benefit is that most readers will have had experience with a web browser
and visiting websites online, so you may already have one installed.

There also will be more related readings regarding topics on programming, algorithms, and
other resources to find more information on particular topics. Initially, there will be some setup
to begin going through the material so that you can install a code editor. Extensions will also be suggested
as well to facilitate a more professional setting (also convenient). Several considerations come in to play
when setting up one's development environment, but being exposed to your options will play just as
big a part as being able to use it. Just like most programs, the more you dig into it, the more it can
do for you. In this case especially, that means saving large amounts of time by setting yourself up
to have these benefits.

Programming is a very broad topic, and almost all areas of study are affected by this. You could
specialize in Data Science, Networking, Security, Web Development, Devops, Graphics, Games,
Robotics, and Embedded Systems just to name a few. All of these topics each serve as an umbrella for
vast amounts of subdomains in each domain respectively. If you have a solid grip on the fundamentals
of programming and start recognizing patterns within each, jumping to things like shell scripting can
start to almost be familiar without experience in that specific domain.

> **Note:**
> For example, you may be new to the concept of things like flags in a command line such as,
> `git commit -m "Hi!"`. Here the flag is `-m` indicating a message is going to be added. The logical
> structure of the command is more apt to make sense to us though. Here the program is `git`, and the
> git command (function) would be `commit`. Here the function `commit` is being told it will have
> a message parameter being passed, which is the argument `"Hi!"`. This is used instead of parenthesis,
> and uses argument positioning to indicate which parameter the argument represents.

My hope here is not to select one of these disciplines for you, but to give you the tools to be
effective at any. The basics are still the basics across all of them. Programming is similar to other
disciplines, including music. At the beginning stages of music you end up memorizing how to play
songs, not truly understanding the underpinnings of the construction of each of the notes in those
songs. This is a necessary part of the process, and as you get better you start analyzing the song
in depth for multiple parts of its construction. One of the things I want to highlight is that
some people can get stuck in this phase though. This relies heavily on memorization, routine, and
using only what is familiar. Using such a process works fine, and some people do this their entire
careers. The thing is, at least in my opinion, these people are working much harder memorizing
things constantly to keep up, instead of understanding the inner workings of things. The same can
be said for programming. Taking the extra time to get closer to understanding something can end up saving
you incredible amounts of time in the future. Really, some of your career options may start to become
limited if you do not understand the process of automating your tasks in order to get more things
done on a daily basis.

The theme of this message is really to see things as a constant learning experience. There will be many
topics that you learn that may not appear all that related at first, but you will inevitably recognize
a pattern somewhere due to these experiences. Honestly, a surprising amount of coding can be improved by taking
the time to write things in a thoughtful manner. Making sure readability is a primary concern will
help everyone in the long run. If done properly, it could even serve as documentation on how things
can or should be implemented, serving as learning material and being easily maintainable.

It is now your choice to jump into walking through the creation of a modern website, or going over
related material. I would encourage possibly starting with the beginning of the Website Setup section
to get a general feel and see what will be covered. There you will introduced to languages that help facilitate
making websites, settings up a programming environment, common tools, and other related readings pertaining to
website creation. This may make more sense than jumping into the intermediate and advanced related material,
unless you are already familiar with many of these topics.

Below I will recommended courses, websites, and books to broaden your general programming knowledge. They will
be given a general order to be studied so that the material feels applicable with
the knowledge acquired by each. Some of the material will take serious time commitments, though you are free
to browse through what they have to offer and study them in-depth when it is appropriate, or when you have the
time. At this point, you should have enough knowledge to follow through with the Website Setup, and possibly
understand some of the code contained within the example site this learning is built around. With that said,
brushing up on more topics can never hurt in adding to your knowledge base. Possibly, if you feel overwhelmed by
any particular portion, using these references may help you get back on course, or give you a chance to jump
around to other topics. Being exposed to more ideas can sometimes shed light on others, or possibly other
learning formats may be more beneficial to certain individuals. Good luck!

As technology improves, or people's skill sets grow, things can constantly be modified to be more readable, and easily maintainable. This book highlights the backbone of these ideas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Much of the material focuses on common algorithms and expected knowledge when going to apply for the more elite companies as a software engineer. The material is dense if you are not versed in more complex algorithms, but it also gives a great baseline for good code structuring, as well as common concepts that begin to become expected with being an engineer. This book is arguably the most difficult to get through on the list, but having it around will really make a difference if you want to get to the next level of your career. |

The code examples are not deep, but the overall descriptions and internal implementation details are quite involved. It may be helpful to view the MySQL for Developers resource provided by PlanetScale above before going into this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Additional Resources:**

In addition to all of these wonderful resources, there are plenty of other sites that offer a variety of courses
on several topics. Many of these have free options, and in addition may have paid options for more material.
Taking a chance to look into these other options may prove fruitful if you are interested in a particular
subject and you are able to find an instructor or course setup that presents the material to your liking.
There are likely countless other resources you can find, but I will include the ones that I have used in the
past. I will also link other forms of media that touch on computer programming and web development in general.
Below are some mentions.

| Web Series          | Laracasts                  | Contains several web series based around Laravel (PHP full stack framework).                                       | [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)                 | Laracasts hosts series from many reputable figures, and highly skilled instructors. This site focuses on PHP as a backend with Laravel as the framework, but in many cases will still introduce you to Javascript and the frontend in general. These courses will tend to be more full stack in nature, but I believe they present the material in a way that is suitable for all skill levels. Some quick Google searches and references to the Laravel documentation can help you get setup to begin learning with the language. This site is very general in the material it touches in relation to web development. I would recommend [30 Days to Learn Laravel](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11) as a starting point and a sample for the quality of their content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

There are other sites that have similar layouts to their lessons, and some of these lessons can be completely done from the browser without having to install anything. Others may require installations, but should provide the relevant documentation to accomplish their appropriate setups.

AWS is just one option that provides IaaS (Infrastructure as as Service). Others would include Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. I spent a considerable amount of time on this site and practice tests provided with the certificate trainings. In specific, I went through this free module [Solutions Architect - Knowledge Badge Readiness Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/public/learning_plan/view/1044/solutions-architect-knowledge-badge-readiness-path), as well as other free material in order to study and receive an "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate" certificate. There are also many paid options on this site if you would like more hands on material, and possibly better guidance if you choose to prepare for a certificate. <br/><br/> Certificates can be very helpful in catching potential employer's eyes, and increasing your chances of selection for employment opportunities. With that said, the tests to earn the certificates do cost money. It is always helpful to investigate what certificates would be relevant to the positions you are applying for, rather than earning them for the sake of having them. Optionally, you could always build projects with the relevant technology to demonstrate experience as well. |
